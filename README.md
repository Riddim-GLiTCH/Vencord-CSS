# Vencord-CSS
Collection of CSS snippets for use with Vencord

## To install these snippets:
Simply select the snippet you would like to use from the repository above, and click `raw` and copy the URL.
Then in Discord, under settings, go to `Vencord/Themes` And paste the URL in a new line.

Alternatively, or if you dont have Vencord, you can copy the contents of the CSS file and paste it in your Custom CSS file.
Please note that some snippets require Vencord to be installed in order to function properly. Whilce Custom CSS is a globally compatible Discord modification, Vencord has its own elements that can be altered with custom styling that other client mods simply do not have.


### To Do:
- [ ] Figure out a better system to organize snippets.

- [ ] Add my other snippets.
